<p>[Narrator:]
Rolling out motherfuckers it's the Robots in Disguise
Led by Optimus Prime, a bot whose power never dies
Cars and vans and planes, fuckin' construction trucks
They're going under cover cause Decepticons don't give a fuck.</p>

<p>[Optiumus:]
Autobots it's time for rolling out.
[Kid:]
Oh my God, that truck is Optimus without a doubt!
[Optiumus:]
Uh, no I'm not.
[Kid:]
Yes you are my dearest robot bro
You guys been on my lunch box since the 19 fuckin' 80's yo
[Optiumus:]
Oh balls, Autobots listen here
I think it's time to try to find another way to disappear
New disguises that our enemies can never recognize
Bumblebee become a burger! Prowl you are a side of fries!
[Bumblebee:]
Huh?
[Optiumus:]
Do it! Don't you wanna light our darkest hour
Jazz you are a birthday cake, you got the touch I got the flour!</p>
